# 00 — Master Guardrails (prepend to every phase prompt)

**Project Context:** We are refactoring a fork of Logseq into a **file-first** monorepo. Files (Markdown/Org) are the **source of truth**. A **sidecar SQLite index** in `.graph/` accelerates search/backlinks and keeps history. New clients (Desktop/Mobile) use `@logseq/file-core` only.

**Golden Rules:**
- Edit only files listed in **FILES TO TOUCH** for the current phase.
- TypeScript strict; no thrown errors across package boundaries — use typed results.
- No cross-package private imports; use only documented public exports.
- If ambiguous, add `TODO:` comments. Do **not** expand scope.
- Output: file diffs/new contents + exact shell commands to run. Stop when **ACCEPTANCE** passes.
